It's expected to be around 18°C with partly cloudy conditions and a gentle breeze.\n\nConsider bringing lightweight jackets or sweaters that can be easily added or removed as needed. You may also want to pack some warmer clothing, such as a light coat or cardigan, in case the temperature drops slightly during the evening hours.\n\nIn terms of specific items, consider packing:\n\n* 3-4 tops or shirts (lightweight and breathable)\n* 2-3 pairs of pants or trousers (comfortable and versatile)\n* 1-2 lightweight jackets or sweaters\n* A light coat or cardigan for cooler evenings\n* Undergarments and socks\n* Comfortable walking shoes or sneakers\n* Dressier outfit for evening events or dinners\n\nRemember to check the weather forecast again before your trip to ensure you're prepared for any changes in conditions. Enjoy Paris!",
